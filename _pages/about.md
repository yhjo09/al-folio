I'm a Ph.D. (M.S./Ph.D. integrated course) student at Dept. of Computer Science, Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Seon Joo Kim.


My research interests focus on Computational Photography and Deep Learning.
Particularly, I am interested in Deep Learning based Image/Video Restoration (Super-Resolution, Deblurring) and Generation.


I received the B.S. degree in Computer Science at Yonsei University, in 2015.
